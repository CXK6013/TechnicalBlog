# 译 软件中的安全漏洞是什么?  献给外行人的软件漏洞指南

[TOC]

If you’re reading this, you’ve probably heard about the vulnerability that was recently discovered in the [log4j library](https://logging.apache.org/log4j). 

当你在读这篇文章的时候，你可能已经提说了最近发生在log4j库的一个漏洞。

Or maybe this is a few years in the future, and yet another huge software vulnerability has been discovered, and someone passed this post to you in order to help explain what is going on.

或者也可能是在几年以后，又发现了另一个巨大的软件漏洞，有人把这篇文章发给你，希望能帮助你解释发生了什么。

Either way, you’re probably wondering what is happening in the software world that allows these critical undiscovered vulnerabilities to lie dormant for years, only to pop up and cause the entire technology world to collectively lose its mind.

无论哪种方式，你可能都会想到底发生了软件世界中发生了什么，使得这些关键的未发现的漏洞能够潜伏多年，然后突然被发现并导致整个技术界集体失控。

I’m going to start at a pretty fundamental level to explain what is going on, so if you’re a software engineer, you probably won’t get much out of this. However, if you’re not in IT and you really want to understand what in the world is going on, you’re in the right place.

我将从一个相当基本的层面来解释究竟发生了什么，如果你是一个软件工程师，你可能不会有什么收获。然而如果你并不在IT行业，而你又想理解究竟发生了什么，那你就来对地方了。

## Really, what *is* software?  什么是软件? 

We all sorta know what software is. We know it runs on our computer. But what *is* it, really?

我们都大致知道什么是软件。我们直到它在我们的计算机上运行。但实际上，它究竟是什么？

Well, everything that runs on your computer is software. The operating system that you login to when your computer starts up, the applications that you run such as Microsoft Word, the little pop-ups you get reminding you that you haven’t renewed your anti-virus software in 5 years. They are all software.

好，在你电脑上运行的所有东西都是软件，当你的计算机启动时，你所登录的操作系统，你启动的应用程序，如word。你收到五年内没有更新你的反病毒软件的小弹出窗口提醒。它们都是软件。

All of this software is just made up of a bunch of files that your computer knows what to do with.

所有的这些软件都只是由一堆文件组成，你的计算机知道如何处理。

 The Microsoft Word icon on your desktop is a special type of image file, the Word application itself is made up of a bunch of files, that image your friend sent you is a file. Everything is just a different type of file that your computer can interact with.

桌面上word图标是一个特殊的图片文件，Word应用程序本身由一堆文件组成，你朋友发送给你的图片也是一个文件。一切都只是你的计算机可以与之交互的不同类型的文件。

The only real difference between the Word icon on your desktop and an image that your friend sent you is that your computer knows that if you click on the Microsoft Word icon (which is a file), that it needs to start the Microsoft Word application.

你桌面上的word图标和你朋友发给你的图片唯一的不同的是，你的计算知道当你点击word图标，需要启动的是word应用程序。

At this level, that is all you need to know. Everything on your computer is made up of many hundreds of thousands of files. All different kinds. 

在这个层面上，这就是你需要知道的全部。你计算机上上的一切都由成千上万个文件组成。

And your computer knows how to interact with most of them. Click on an image file, your computer opens up an application that works with images. Click on a link to a website, your computer will open up a web browser ([what is a web browser?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser)).

而你的计算知道如何与其中大多数文件进行交互。点击一个图像文件，你的计算机会打开一个处理图像的应用程序。点击一个网站链接，你的计算机会打开一个网络浏览器。

Files, all the way down.

文件，一切都是文件。

 This can get a bit more complicated though, because when you open up a web browser like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, you’re going to a website and you’re viewing data that was sent to your computer by another computer somewhere on the internet.

但这可能有点复杂，当你在浏览器上打开一个网站，比如使用chrome浏览器、edge浏览器，访问网站得到的数据是一个计算机通过互联网发送给你的数据。

That other computer, called a server ([What is a server?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing))), is sitting somewhere else on the planet. When you typed in “[www.google.com](http://www.google.com/)” a server over at Google sent you a bunch of files and your web browser used those files to display a web page to you. Pretty neat.

其他计算机，被称为服务器，躺在这个星球的某个地方。当你输入”www.google.com“时，谷歌的服务器会向你发送一系列文件，而你的浏览器则利用这些文件来显示一个网页给你。这相当酷。

However, it is still just a bunch of files, only this time they were sent to you over the internet.

然而，他们仍然是一堆文件，只是这次他们通过网络发送给你。

## But what are these files made of? 但这些文件由什么组成？

Okay, so your computer is just a bunch of files. Great. But what is actually going into these files? That is a bit harder to explain, but I’ll give it a shot.

所以你的计算机只是由一堆文件组成，这些文件里面实际上是什么，这有点难以解释，但我会尝试说明一下。

All software is written in what we call “programming languages”. A programming language is just a bunch of text that can be translated into a set of operations that your computer knows what to do with.

软件被程序语言书写。编程语言只是一堆文本，可以被转化为一组你计算机理解的操作。

Here is a little snippet of what a programming language looks like:

下面有一个编程语言的小代码块: 

```go
import "fmt"

func main() {
     fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```

This is what people usually refer to as “code”. 

这就是人们常说的代码

It isn’t important what this piece of code does, just know that all software is just made up of a bunch of files that have reams of text like what you see above. And know that some person, somewhere, had to write all of that text.

这段代码是做什么的并不重要，只要知道所有的软件都是由一堆文件组成，这些文件有大量的文本，就像你上面看到的。而却要知道，某个人在某个地方必须编写所有这些文本。

In order to make that text into something a computer can use, there is a special program called a “compiler”. The compiler takes this text, and turns it into a bunch of instructions that your computer can run, and shoves those instructions into a file (or a bunch of files). So when you run an application like Google Chrome, your computer finds the “compiled” Chrome file, opens it, and starts performing each instruction.

为了让这些文本可以被你的计算机识别，需要一个被称为“编译器”的特殊程序。编译器将这些文本转化为你的计算机可以运行的一堆指令，并将这些指令塞入一个文件(或一堆文件)。所以当你启用应用程序像chrome，你的计算机会找到被编译后的chrome文件，打开的，然后运行指令。

That is really all your computer does, all day long. It just sits there opening up file after file, reading out instructions and running them one after another over and over and over. All day, every day.

这就是你的电脑所做的一切，整天都是如此。它只是躺在那里，打开一个又一个文件，读出指令，然后一遍一遍地运行它们。一整天，每天。

## I’m not really getting any closer to understanding security vulnerabilities. 我还是没理解安全漏洞是什么意思

I know, I know, bear with me. We are getting closer. So we have all of these special files on our computer that are full of a bunch of instructions created by “compilers”. And our computer just goes through these files executing the instructions. 

我知道，我知道，再忍耐一下，我们在接近答案了。所以我们的计算机上有一堆特殊的文件，里面是编译器创建的一对指令。我们的计算机只需按照这些指令执行操作。

These instructions are really simple operations though, they aren’t complex things like “show the Chrome window to the user” it is simple instructions like “add these two numbers together” or “put a dot on the screen in this location”.

这些指令非常简单，他们并不像“显示chrome窗口给用户看”这些复杂，而是一些简单的指令，像是将两个数相加，或者在屏幕的某个位置画一个点。

The instructions are actually even more fundamental than that, but I think you get the idea.

实际的指令会更原始，但我想你会明白我的意思。

 These instructions are incredibly basic, and it takes a TON of these instructions for applications to do anything.

指令是非常基本的，而应用程序需要大量的这些指令才能做任何事情。

These instructions have to be really simple, because that way you can combine a ton of these instructions in different ways and cause your computer to do pretty much anything. 

这些指令必须非常简单，这样你就可以用各种不同的方式组合大量指令，从而可以让你的计算机几乎可以做一切事情。

If these instructions were complex like “draw a button on the screen”, then you’d need tons of very specific instructions to do anything.  

如果这些指令像“在屏幕上画一个按钮”这样复杂的话，那么你需要大量非常具体的指令才能完成几乎任何你想让它执行的任务。

You’d need a “green button” instruction to draw a green button and a “red button” instruction to draw a red button. This would get out of hand quickly.

你需要绿色按钮指令去绘制绿色按钮，红色按钮指令去绘制红色按钮。很快就会失去控制。

But instead, we have a bunch of incredibly basic instructions that we can string together to draw a red button or a green button. 

相反，我们有的只是一堆基本的指令，那我们就可以将其组合起来去绘制红色按钮或绿色按钮。

These very simple instructions would cause the computer to draw, pixel by pixel ([what in the world is a pixel?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel)), each piece of the button.

这些非常简单的指令驱使计算机逐像素的去绘制按钮的每个部分。

 Because we are using very simple instructions, we can combine them in an infinite number of ways to draw anything on the screen, including the letters you’re reading right now.

因为使用了非常简单的指令，我们可以无限组合它们让这些指令可以在屏幕是那个绘制任何东西，包括您现在正在阅读的字母。

In order to produce all of these instructions, we need a lot of code. Your computer is pretty dumb, it just sits there all day running instructions. So the code we write needs to tell your computer every single thing it needs to do… in EXCRUCIATING detail.

为了生产所有这些指令，我们需要大量的代码。您的计算机相当愚笨，整天只是坐在那里执行指令。因此，我们编写的代码需要以及其详细的方式告诉您的计算机需要做每一件事情......，详细到令人痛苦的程度。

For example, let’s look at the web browser example from earlier. You are typing in an address for www.google.com into your browser, what needs to happen in order for that to work?  If I told you, you wouldn’t believe me. Many thousands of things. 

例如，让我们回顾一下之前提到的网络浏览器示例，您在浏览器中输入了谷歌的地址，为了让你浏览到网页发生了什么？ 如果我告诉您，您可能不会相信，发生了数不胜数的事情。

Everything from interpreting the keystrokes from your keyboard to drawing the letters on your screen to making requests across the internet to Google. But each of those actions is made up of many hundreds of thousands of very simple instructions.

这包括读取您按下键盘的键位在屏幕上绘制字母，再通过互联网向Google发送请求的一切。但是每个动作都是由成千上万个非常简单的指令组成。

Unreal, right?  Don’t worry, programmers don’t really understand all of it either.

真不可思议，是嘛？  不要担心，即使是程序员也难以理解其中的每一个细节。

It is so complicated that it is hard to wrap your mind around it. And that is one of the big secrets that almost all software engineers share. 

这件事是如此复杂，以至于很难完全理解。这几乎是所有软件工程师共享的一个重要秘密之一。

Most of us are dumbfounded as to how it all works so well. It is unbelievably complicated. And nobody really understands all of it.

我们之中的大多数人对于它的出色工作，感觉惊讶不已。它是令人难以置信的复杂，而且没有人真正理解这一切。

## Is it starting to feel like a house of cards?  是不是开始觉得像纸牌屋了

Now you know how software engineers feel.

现在你应该知道软件工程师的感受了。

You might be wondering at this point, if all of these millions of instructions are needed to accomplish really simple tasks, then how in the world does anything get done? I’m glad you asked, because now we are really starting to get somewhere. Software engineers don’t have to write all of the code that runs in their applications!

也许您会对这个问题有疑问，如果要完成非常简单的任务需要数百万条指令，那么计算机是如何完成世界上形形色色的一切呢？ 我很高兴你这么问，因为软件工程师不必编写他们应用程序的所有代码。

If software engineers had to write every line of code that went into modern applications, even the simplest of applications would take years to write. Even a team of software engineers would take years to write the simplest of applications.

如果软件工程师不得不编写现代应用程序的每一行代码，那么即使是最简单的应用程序也需要花费数年，即使是一个团队，也不例外。

The reason is that every application leverages code written by many thousands of other engineers. 

原因在于每个应用程序都利用了成千上万其他工程师编写的代码。

Thousands of engineers? Yep. As an example, applications leverage huge amounts of code that lives in your [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) (the application that runs your whole computer). 

成千上万？ 是的，举个例子，应用程序使用了大量您操作系统的代码，这就是运行在Windows上的应用程序，运行在Mac OS的程序也很相似的原因。这些应用程序和操作系统协同工作，在屏幕上绘制，连接到互联网，弹出通知。

That is the reason why applications that run on Windows all look very similar, and applications that run on MacOS all look very similar. Those applications are working with the operating system to draw things on the screen, connect to the internet, pop up notifications, etc…

The software that runs your computer, the operating system, is absolutely enormous. Windows 10 is roughly 50 million lines of code. 50 MILLION. So let’s say a novel has about 20 lines of text per page, we are talking about 2.5 million pages, or well over 11,000 copies of the first Harry Potter book.

您计算机上的操作系统，代码量是巨大的。 Windows 10 大约有5000万行代码，是的，5000万行！ 假设一本小说每页有20行文字，那么我们就需要250万页来容纳这么多代码，相当于超过11000本《哈利.波特》第一部的页数。

That would be a pile of Harry Potter books reaching almost as high as the Eiffel Tower, or roughly 2/3rds of the way up the Empire State Building. 

堆积起来的高度将和埃菲尔铁塔一样高，或者帝国大厦的三分之二。

And this isn’t just english text, this is detailed computer code that has been written and rewritten over and over by myriads of people.

这些代码也不仅仅是英语文本，而是经过无数人编写和修改的细致复杂的计算代码。

Hard to believe, right?

这一点很难让人相信，不是嘛？

And that is just the software that is part of Windows. Our applications need to accomplish a lot of tasks that other similar applications need to do too. 

而这只是作为Windows一部分的软件。我们的应用程序也需要完成很多相似应用完成的任务。

Things like manipulating image files, displaying pdfs, displaying web pages, playing music, taking payments, etc… almost any broadly applicable functionality you can think of.

比如处理图片文件，显示PDF，显示页面，播放音乐，支付等，几乎是你能想象的任何功能。

Applications share a lot of functionality between each other. And so programming languages use special files called “libraries”. 

应用共享功能，程序语言使用称为”库“的特殊文件。

These libraries are bundles of files that contain functionality that an application can use. 

库是包含应用程序需要使用的功能的一捆文件。

Think of them like a toolbox for an application. Your application needs a hammer? Well, it isn’t worth it to build a hammer, we have a hammer in this library over here, let’s just use that one.

我们可以将其想象为应用程序的工具箱，你的应用需要个锤子? 那么自己制作一个锤子是不值当的，我们这个库里面有这个锤子，那么就用这个锤子吧。 Individual applications can leverage thousands of these libraries to perform all kinds of tasks. Software engineers pull in all of these libraries because why would you want to write all of this code, when someone else has already created it for you?

独立开发者可以利用成千上万个库来执行各种任务。软件工程师利用这些库，如果别人已经为你编写了这些代码，你为什么还要自己在写一遍呢？

And so, in many applications, these libraries have a lot more code in them than the applications themselves.

所以一些应用里面，代码库的代码要比应用自身的还要多。

To put that in perspective, let’s say that I have a relatively small application made up of about 50,000 lines of code that my team wrote. 

从这个角度来看，假设我有一个相对比较小的应用程序，我们团队编写的代码在大约50000行左右。

I might use external libraries that are made up of a few million lines of code, and then I’m running on top of an operating system made up of tens of millions of lines of code. 

我可能使用了数百万行代码的外部库，而且我还要在由数千万行代码组成的操作系统上运行。

Modern applications leverage a staggeringly large amount of external code.

Security vulnerabilities can occur in any of this code.

漏洞就可能发生在这些代码中。

## We have finally arrived at security vulnerabilities  终于到达了安全漏洞

In all of these millions of lines of code, a security vulnerability can be lurking almost anywhere. 

在这数百万行代码中，安全漏洞可能埋藏在任何一处。

But what do I really mean by a security vulnerability?  Well, a security vulnerability is just some defect in the code that causes the code to do something it isn’t supposed to, in a way that allows an unauthorized person control of a system or access to data.

实际上，我所指的安全漏洞， 指的是代码中有些缺陷，导致代码以一种不应该的方式运行，

As an example, let’s say in one of those millions of lines of code, there is an instruction that a programmer wrote that says essentially “if the value coming from the user in this text field starts with ‘hacked:’ then take whatever is after that and treat it like an internet link.” So someone goes to your application, and types in “hacked:www.google.com” and it causes your application to see that text and it tries to access “www.google.com”.

举个例子，在这数百万行代码中，假设有一个程序员编写的指令: "如果来自用户的文本值是以hacked: 开头，那么将后面的内容将被视为链接"。 所以如果有人访问你的应用输入: hacked: www.google.com， 它将会导致你的应用访问www.google.com.

That doesn’t sound so bad, unless the code is also supposed to take whatever is at that address and then try to do something else with it.

听起来好像没有那么糟糕，除非代码支持携带任何地址，然后然尝试去做一些事情。

 Maybe the application is supposed to load whatever is at that location and then try to run it like it is part of the application? 

也许这个程序的意图是加载特定位置的内容，并尝试将其作为应用程序的一部分运行？

Then a user can type in “hacked:www.myevildomain.com” and get your application to load their malicious code into your application. 

然后用户输入"hacked:www.myevildomain.com" , 在你的应用程序将恶意代码记载。

If this application is running on a website such as Facebook, Google, Instagram, etc… then doing that could allow that attacker to run code that can give them access to the data stored there by other users. You now have a security breach on your hands.

如果这个应用程序像facebook、google、Instagram的运行模式一样等，那么攻击者可能会利用该漏洞运行代码，从而获取用户存储的数据，这时就会出现安全漏洞的情况。



## But why would someone do that?   但是为什么有人这么做呢？

The above example is very contrived. Of course no programmer is going to purposefully provide a way for someone to load someone else’s code into their application.

这个例子非常牵强。没有程序员会提供一种方式将别人的代码记载进自己的应用。

 That is software security 101. But applications are doing things all of the time that require them to take some kind of data from a user, whether that is a piece of text from a form in a web browser, or an image that a user uploads.

这是软件基础的应用常识。当时应用程序经常要从用户那里获取数据，无论是浏览器的表单中的文本，还是用户上传的图片。

 Applications take in a ton of data from users, and then they need to process it in some way.

应用程序从用户那里接收了大量的数据，然后以某种方式对其进行处理。

That is a lot of data to clean and make sure it is safe. By taking in and processing this data, it provides a lot of opportunities for a specially crafted piece of data to cause a program to operate in a way that the programmer didn’t intend. 

有大量的用户需要清理来确保数据安全。通过接收和处理这些数据，会为特意构造的某个数据片段提供很多机会，使程序以程序员未曾预料的方式运行。

Let’s say that a hacker uploads a file to an image sharing service that looks like an image file, but instead is filled with some commands that the hacker wants to run.

我们假设一个黑客将文件上传到图片共享服务，这个文件看起来像是一个图片文件，但实际上里面填充的事黑客希望运行的一些命令。

The hacker knows that the website they are uploading this file to is using a specific library to process image uploads, and they know that the library looks at the start of the image file for a particular set of values and then will run some commands in response to those values, passing in the data from the image file. 

黑客知道他们正在上传文件操作的网站使用了一些特别的库来处理图片上传，他们知道库会查看文件开头的一组特定值，然后根据这些值执行一些特殊的命令，并将图片文件数据传递出去。

This kind of thing is done all of the time to process images uploaded to websites to resize them, or apply an overlay to the image, add a filter, etc… if the library isn’t incredibly careful about how it ensures the data from the image is valid, it can accidentally execute commands that the hacker passed to it. Some variation of this has been the source of many security vulnerabilities in the past.

这种情况经常发生在处理上传到网站的图像上，用于调整大小、叠加效果、添加滤镜等等。如果该库在确保图片数据有效性方面不够谨慎，就可能意外执行黑客传递给它的命令，类似的情况在过去发生了很多。

And at its core, this is really the source of most software security vulnerabilities. Taking in data from users… images, files, text… and being tricked into doing something inappropriate with it. Because of the fact that there are so many millions of lines of code being used by most applications, it is impossible to audit all of it and look for every possible type of defect.

这就是大多数软件安全漏洞的源头，处理来自用户的数据，图片，文件，文本，然后被诱导以不恰当的方式来处理。由于大多数应用使用了数百万行代码，因此不可能对其进行全面的审计来所有的缺陷。

The only reason these flaws aren’t found more often is because most applications have pretty good security practices baked into them, and most libraries have a lot of people looking at the code.

这些缺陷之所以不经常出现原因在于大多数应用有相当不错的安全实践，并且大多数库都有很多人审计代码。

 But every so often a subtle bug finds its way into a library that goes unnoticed for years because it is something that is very rarely used… and that is what happened with log4j.

但是偶尔就会有一个微妙的错误进入到一个库中，并且由于它很少被使用，这个错误可能在多年间被忽略，这就是发生在log4j身上的情况。

## But what about log4j log4j呢

The log4j vulnerability was very similar to the website example that I described above. The log4j library is used in applications for writing information out to log files. Log files are files that record everything an application does and are used to troubleshoot issues that arise. A log file might look something like this:

log4j的安全漏洞和我上面描述的网站例子十分相似。log4j库在应用程序里面被用于向日志文件里面写入信息。日志文件记录了应用做的一切，被用于定位问题。日志文件里面的内容像下面这样

```log4j
06:42:16.423Z  INFO cool_app: start
06:42:16.427Z  INFO cool_app: responding to request from 52.38.16.32 path /hello
06:42:16.433Z  INFO cool_app: responding to request from 12.22.18.45 path /whatever
06:42:16.438Z  INFO cool_app: something weird happened
```

Log4j had a feature in it that allowed a special piece of text to be placed in a log message that would cause the library to do something special with that text. If text was wrapped with “${}” then the library would do something special with it. It might look something like this:

Log4J有个特性就是允许在日志文件里面放置一个特殊的文本片段，log4j会这个特殊文本做特殊操作，它可能像下面这样:

```
“${my_value}”
```

This allows a developer to insert a special value into a log message and it would do something with that value and replace it. Here is an example:

这允许开发者在日志信息里面插入一个特殊的值，用其他值去替代这个特殊的文本片段

```java
“${date:MM-dd-yyyy} - My Log Message”
```

Then this would actually get written into the log file:

实际上写入文件内容的如下所示:

```log
09-12-2021 - My Log Message
```

This is really useful functionality. It allows you to automatically replace values in your log message without knowing the values up-front.  

这是非常实用的功能，允许你在日志消息中替换值，而无需预先知道这些值。

These replacements could be used in combination with another piece of functionality called JNDI that actually came from a different library. 

这些替换可以和另一个被称为JNDI的库结合起来使用，JNDI是另外一个库。

JNDI allows you to look up values in a variety of ways, some of them allowing you to make requests over the network or internet to get a value. That could look something like this:

JNDI允许以多种方式查找值，其中一些方式是允许你通过网络来发送请求获取值，看起来像下面这样。

```java
“${jndi:ldap://www.mywebsite.com/somepath}”
```

This would make a call out to “ldap://www.mywebsite.com/somepath” and could even try to run code that came back from it.

它将对ldap://www.mywebsite.com/somepath进行访问，甚至运行从这个地址返回的代码。

 This could be useful functionality, but these substitutions should always occur only on text provided by the application, never by the user. 

  这可能是个有用的功能，但是这些替代应当只在应用程序提供的文本上发生，而不是由用户提供的文本上。

 Log4j had, for a long time, allowed these substitutions to occur in any user-provided text that might make it into the logs.

在很长一段时间里，Log4j允许这些替换在可能出现在日志中的任何用户提供的文本中发生。

So all a user had to do was to perform an action against a website that might cause a value to be written into the logs, and they could get this functionality to run.

所以用户只需对可能导致某个值被写入日志的网站执行一个操作，就可以使这个功能运行起来。

Because this was such a minor feature in a large library (log4j has over 175,000 lines of code spread across over 2000 files), this went unnoticed for a really long time. (Why a library that writes logs to files is over 175,000 lines of code is unfortunately a discussion for another time.)

因为这只是一个大型库的一个小功能(log4j有超过17.5w行代码，分布在2000个文件中)，所以很长时间没有被注意到了(为什么一个将日志写入文件的库有17.5w行的代码，不幸的是这是另外一个话题了)

## Now you know the software industry’s dirty little secret 现在你已经直到了软件行业的秘辛了

Software is unbelievably complex and is built upon millions of lines of code, and no one has the ability to audit all of that code. 

软件难以相信的复杂建立在数百万行代码上，没有人有能力能够审计所有的代码。

Software engineers rely on popular libraries like log4j, because it would take them inordinate amounts of time to replicate that kind of functionality on their own.

软件工程师依赖于一些流行的库，像log4j，如果他们想要自己开发就需要花费大量的时间。

Software engineers also like to use libraries like log4j because they are used by millions of other developers, and so having that much usage and that many eyes on a piece of software can help find and flush out many of the security issues.

软件工程师也喜欢log4j这样的库，因为被数百万开发者使用，有这么多的使用量和这么多眼睛盯着一个软件，可以帮忙发现很多安全问题。

However, every once in a while something like this happens. You have a very widely used library, combined with a rarely used feature that has a subtle flaw in it, and that flaw can go unnoticed for years. 

然而，每隔一段时间就会发生这样的事情，一个被广泛使用的库，在这个库里面有一个很少被使用的功能，在这个功能里有一个微妙的缺陷，这个缺陷可能很多年都没被注意到。

Inevitably people will now go scouring other libraries that are similar to log4j, looking for bugs like this elsewhere, and will probably find a few.

现在的人会不可避免的搜索log4j类似的库，寻找类似的漏洞，然后可能会找到一些。

There are tons of other security flaws like this, sitting out in the wild just waiting to be found.

有大量的安全漏洞在等着被发现。

 The software engineer community has created a program called [CVE](https://www.cve.org/) which stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. It is a warning system for software engineers to alert them of flaws found in the libraries they are using to write software.

软件工程师社区创建了一个叫CVE的项目，CVE是Common  Vulnerabilities  Exposures(通用安全漏洞)的缩写，用于提醒软件工程师在他们使用的库里面发现的缺陷。

Even a security flaw that is fairly minor will get issued a CVE number, and will be reported through tooling that most software engineers use. This way, software engineers can know when they need to update their libraries in order to keep their users safe.

即使是非常小的安全漏洞也会获得一个CVE编号，并通过大多数软件工程师使用的工具报告。如此，软件工程师就能够直到合适更新他们的库来保证用户的安全。
